    "    RGBA stands for \"Red, Green, Blue, Alpha.\" It is a color model used in digital imaging and computer graphics to represent colors with a combination of red, green, and blue components, along with an additional alpha channel that represents the opacity or transparency of the color.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the RGBA color model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Red (R) represents the amount of red color in the color mixture, typically specified as an integer value between 0 and 255 or as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
